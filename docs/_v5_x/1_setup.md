## Nuget package

The client library is available as a nuget package. The client library (and associated nuget package) is updated regularly as new functionality is added.

The library has several packages with the prefix `Digipost.Signature.Api.Client`. If you are using the portal cases, use `Digipost.Signature.Api.Client.Portal`, and for direct cases, use `Digipost.Signature.Api.Client.Direct`. 

## The documentation for sending and error handling is moved
 
 The documentation for v5 sending is moved to [signering docs](https://signering-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). All older versions can still be browsed here.
